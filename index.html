            <h2>Project Rationale</h2>
            <p>Menstruation, the monthly discharge of blood and mucosal tissues from the inner lining of the uterus, is a natural process that signifies a woman’s reproductive health. Yet, for many girls, it’s far more than biology; it’s a complex experience that intersects with culture, poverty, and societal norms...</p>

            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="container" id="project-description">
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>At Aluso Foundation, we recognize that empowering girls goes beyond textbooks and classrooms. Our mission is clear: to enhance the well-being and dignity of teenage girls in Narok South sub-county by addressing critical aspects of menstrual health and thus end period poverty...</p>
            <h3>Target Schools</h3>
            <p>We have carefully selected sixteen public primary schools where our impact can be most significant. These schools: Maji Moto, Kuntai, Olenkuluo, Ntuka, Nkineji, Entiapirri, Nkitintini, Nterere, Ilubi, Kipsongol, Oldisare, Ole Pariata, Olenkapune, Oloirien, Nkorkorri, and Olmusakwa represent diverse communities within Narok County.</p>
            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education Sessions:</strong> We believe knowledge is power. In dedicated sessions for girls in grades 6 to 8, we’ll discuss menstruation, sexual health, and related topics. Our aim is to empower girls with accurate information, dispel myths, and promote healthy choices.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Support:</strong> Menstruation isn’t just physical; it impacts emotions and self-esteem. Our trained counsellors will provide support, ensuring that girls navigate this crucial stage confidently.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitary Pad Distribution:</strong> We’ll distribute three packets of sanitary pads to each girl. Recognizing the financial strain many families face, these supplies will last them through three menstrual cycles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Collaborating closely with teachers, we’ll identify 270 girls in grades 6 to 8 per school—those who need our support the most. By focusing on the vulnerable, we maximize our impact. Our initial goal is to enroll 4,050 girls. However, if resources allow, we’re committed to expanding our reach. We believe every girl deserves access to proper menstrual care.</p>
            <h3>Beyond the Classroom</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open Discussions:</strong> In small groups of 12 girls, we’ll facilitate open discussions. These roundtable sessions will allow girls to share their challenges during menstruation, fostering empathy and understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Tusemane Clubs:</strong> Inspired by the Swahili word for “we talk,” we’ll create safe spaces within schools. Girls-only clubs, guided by health teachers and female educators, will encourage open dialogue about sexuality and menstruation. Girls can freely discuss their experiences and even borrow sanitary pads from peers when needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Aluso Foundation envisions a Narok South sub-county where no girl misses school because of her period. We believe that by addressing the critical aspects of menstrual health, we can create a brighter future for every girl in our community.</p>
